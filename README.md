```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml
```

## Playbooks

### Migration tool - migrate_controller.yml
Playbook `migrate_controller.yml` can be used to selectively migrate Ansible controller data from one deployment to another deployment without saving the data to a file.  Ansible tags can be used to select which groups of data to migrate.

#### Variables
The following variables need to be defined when running the playbook:
- controller_host_src - URL of controller to migrate data from
- controller_user_src - Ansible user of controller to migrate data from
- controller_pwd_src - Ansible password of user of controller to migrate data from

- controller_host_dest - URL of controller to migrate data to
- controller_user_dest - Ansible user oauth token of controller to migrate data to
- controller_pwd_dest - Ansible password of user of controller to migrate data to

#### Using tags to limit playbook tasks
The playbook has tags defined for the various tasks so you can use
`--tags` or `--skip-tags` and control which Ansible pieces get migrated.  
By default, all tasks get run.

To see the list of available tags:
```bash
ansible-playbook --list-tags migrate_controller.yml
```

For example, to skip the migration of Users, add this to the `ansible-playbook` command:
```bash
--skip-tags "Users"
```

### Export data - export_controller.yml
Playbook `export_controller.yml` can be used to migrate Ansible controller data from one deployment to another deployment by saving the exported data to a file.

#### Variables
The following variables need to be defined when running the playbook:
- controller_host_src - URL of controller to migrate data from
- controller_user_src - Ansible user of controller to migrate data from
- controller_pwd_src - Ansible password of user of controller to migrate data from

### Import data - import_controller.yml
Playbook `import_controller.yml` can be used to migrate Ansible controller data from one deployment to another deployment by importing data from a file generated by `export_controller.yml`.

#### Variables
The following variables need to be defined when running the playbook:
- controller_host_dest - URL of controller to migrate data to
- controller_user_dest - Ansible user oauth token of controller to migrate data to
- controller_pwd_dest - Ansible password of user of controller to migrate data to
